# TEST MODULE

*Let's play with some tests with our code.*

I'm using [unittest framework](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) to run some tests.
From the project directory run the test cases by using the following command:

    python -m unittest discover -s graph\test\


More details about Unittest framework can be found at the link: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html>
