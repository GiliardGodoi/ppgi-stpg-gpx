# Solving Steiner Tree Problem using Genetic Algorithm

This project aims to solve Steiner Tree Problem in Graph (STPG) using Genetic Algorithm (GA).
Thereby, a crossover operator is propose based in Generalized Partion Crossover (GPX).
Instead handling cycles in a graph, as the original GPX operator, this adaptation must be capable to recombine two partital solutions represented as trees.
