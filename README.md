# Solving Steiner Tree Problem using Genetic Algorithm

The project aims to get better solutions for the Steiner Tree Problem in Graph (STPG) using Genetic Algorithm (GA).

This repository holds the source code for the paper *''A graph-based crossover and soft-repair operators for the Steiner Tree Problem''*, presented at 10th Brazilian Conference on Intelligent Systems. 
The paper publication can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-91702-9_8).

I carried out efforts to attain a better operators implementation. Please, visit the following repositories to futher references: [`pypxst`](https://github.com/GiliardGodoi/pypxst), [`edgesets`](https://github.com/GiliardGodoi/edgesets), [`xsteiner`](https://github.com/GiliardGodoi/xsteiner).
